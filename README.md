# Amethyst

I fixed the AUR Helper Amethyst from Crystal Linux myself because its likely that it won't get updated.

clone the repo

``git clone https://github.com/0xraincandy/amethyst``

compile Amethyst 

``cargo build --release``

copy the binary

``sudo mv ~/amethyst/target/release/ame /usr/bin/``


The original project:
https://gitlab.com/crystal-linux/software/amethyst
